# Simple Timer Application

A Python-based timer application that monitors and displays elapsed time until a specified timeout period is reached.

## Features

- Configurable timeout duration (default: 30 seconds)
- Real-time elapsed time display
- Graceful handling of interruptions and errors
- Clean and consistent output format

## Usage

Run the timer with the default 30-second timeout:
```bash
python dateTime.py
```

Or specify a custom timeout duration (in seconds):
```bash
python dateTime.py 60  # Timer will run for 60 seconds
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Code Structure

The application consists of a single file `dateTime.py` which contains:
- A main [monitor_time](cci:1://file:///Users/pss/devspace/dateTime.py:3:0-28:48) function that handles the timing logic
- Error handling for keyboard interrupts and other exceptions
- Clean output formatting for elapsed time

## Error Handling

The application handles:
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) - gracefully exits with a message
- General exceptions - provides error information

## Output Format

The timer displays elapsed time in seconds until the timeout is reached. Example output:
```
Elapsed time: 1 seconds
Elapsed time: 2 seconds
...
Timeout reached after 30 seconds
```

## Development

The code follows Python best practices including:
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Proper exception handling
- Clean code structure with main guard
- Consistent time tracking using datetime module
